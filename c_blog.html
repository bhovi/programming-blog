    <h1>INTRODUCTION ABOUT CSS</h1>
    <P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen or in
        other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages
        all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
    </P>
    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <P>
        CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the
time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.Style sheets have
existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized
Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide
style sheets for the web.
    </P>
    <H1>MERITS OF CSS</H1>

    </p>
    <h1>TYPES OF CSS</h1>
    <P>
Inline CSS <br>
Internal or Embedded CSS <br>
External CSS <br>
Inline CSS: Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element is known as inline CSS.
This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute. <br>
Internal or Embedded CSS: This can be used when a single HTML
 document must be styled uniquely. The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section 
i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file. <br>
External CSS: External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style
 property with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc). 
 CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. 
This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will  be applied across web pages. 
    </P>
    <h1>CSS COMMENTS</h1>
    <p>
        Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
        Comments are ignored by browsers.
        CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.
    </p>
    <h1>CSS SELECTORS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want
        to style. <br>
        CSS Element Selector <br>
        CSS ID Selector <br>
        CSS Class Selector <br>
        CSS Universal Selector <br>
        CSS Grouping Selector <br>
    </p>
    <h1>CSS COLOR</h1>
    <P>Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.
        A color can be specified by using a predefined color name in CSS.
    </P>
    <h1>BOX MODEL</h1>
    <P>
        The components that can be depicted on the web page consist of one or more
        than one rectangular box <br>
        A CSS box model is a compartment that includes numerous assets, such as
        border, padding and margin.
        It is used to develop the design and structure of a web page
    </P>   
    <h1>BOX MODEL PROPERTIES</h1>
    <p>
        BORDER <br>
        It is a region between the padding-box and the margin. Its proportions are
        determined by the width and height of the boundary. <br>
        MARGIN <br>
       This segment consists of the area between the boundary and the edge of the
       border.The proportion of the margin region is equal to the margin-box width and
       height. It is better to separate the product from its neighbor nodes. <br>
       PADDING <br>
       This field requires the padding of the component. In essence, this area is the
      space around the subject area and inside the border-box. The height and the
       width of the padding box decide its proportions. <br>
       CONTENT <br>
      The content of the box, where text and images appear
    </p>
    <h1>FONT family</h1>
    <p>
        Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of
        formality and elegance. <br>
        Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and
        minimalistic look. <br>
        Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a
        mechanical look. <br>
        Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting. <br>
        Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
