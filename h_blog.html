    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <P>
        HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content,
        in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.
        The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0,
        but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999.

        HTML is light weighted and fast to load.
        Storage of big files are allowed because of the application cache feature.

    <h1>HTML ELEMENTS</h1>
    <p>
        An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
    </p>
    <h1>NESTED HTML ELEMENTS</h1>
    <p>
        TML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
        All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
    </p>
    <h1>EMPTY HTML ELEMENTS</h1>
    <p>
        HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
        The br tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag
    </p>
    <h1>DATA TYPES</h1>
    <p>
        HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data,
        and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length,
        languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on.
        All of these data types are specializations of character data.
    </p>
    <h1>HTML LINKS</h1>
    <P>
        Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way
        from page to page.
        You can click on a link and jump to another document.
        When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little
        hand.
        HTML Links - The target Attribute
        The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
        The target attribute can have one of the following values:
        _self -Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab.
