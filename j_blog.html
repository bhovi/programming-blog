    <h1>JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION AND EVENTS</h1>
    <p>
        
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

    <h1>JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.
Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
