    <h1>INTRODUCTION ABOUT PYTHON</h1>
    <p>
        Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
        Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
        Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
        Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
        Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
    </p>
    <h1>PYTHON DATA TYPES</h1>
    <p>
        In programming, data type is an important concept.

        Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

        Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

        Text Type: str <br>
        Numeric Types: int, float, complex <br>
        Sequence Types: list, tuple, range <br>
        Mapping Type: dict <br>
        Set Types: set, frozenset <br>
        Boolean Type: bool <br>
        Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview <br>
        None Type: NoneType <br>
    </p>
    <h1>PYTHON VARIABLES</h1>
    <p>
        Variables
        Variables are containers for storing data values.

        Creating Variables
        Python has no command for declaring a variable.

        A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type,
        and can even change type after they have been set. <br>
        Variable Names <br>
        A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules
        for Python variables:
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        A variable name cannot start with a number
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    </p>
    <h1>PYTHON DICTIONARY</h1>
    <p>Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

        A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

        As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

        Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values
        Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

        Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.</p>
